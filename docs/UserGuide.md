## Introduction

GuestBook is a **desktop app for managing guests in a hotel,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, GuestBook can get your
guest management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

You can use GuestBook to track guests and their details including name, email address, phone number, 
room number, dates of stay, number of guests, bill, request, and whether their room has been cleaned. 
By allowing you to add, edit, delete, and filter guests, GuestBook can fulfill all your hotel management needs.

This user guide provides in-depth descriptions of all the available features in GuestBook and how to use them.

2. Download the latest `guestbook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/releases). <br> <br>
   ![Ui](images/DownloadInstruction.png) <br><br>
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your GuestBook. <br> <br>
   ![Ui](images/GuestBookIcon.png) <br><br>
4. Double-click on `guestbook.jar` to start the app. The GUI, similar to the image below, should pop up in a few seconds. 
Note that the app contains sample data.<br><br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png) <br><br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

6. To kickstart your journey, you can add a guest, `John Doe`, to GuestBook using the **`add`** command.
   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com rm/05-73 dr/13/09/22 - 15/09/22 ng/3 rq/Extra towels`: Adds a guest named `John Doe` to GuestBook.

7. To find `John Doe`, you can use the **`find`** command, and search any of `John Doe`'s `fields`, such has his name or room. The command below can help you find guests that match the keywords you entered.

   * **`find`** `John Doe` : Finds all the guests where at least one of the fields contains `John` or `Doe` (case-insensitive).

8. To make changes to `John Doe`, you can use the **`edit`** command. This changes the guest's fields based on the values you have inputted. The other values will remain the same. <br> For example, if `John Doe` is the second guest in the list, and you want to change his room number to 05-55, you can do this.
    * **`edit`**`2` `rm/05-55`n: Changes the `Room` of `John Doe` to `05-55` in GuestBook.

9. After running a **`find`** function, you might realise that some of your guests are no longer visible, as they are not in the current list. To see a list of all your guests, you can use the **`list`** command.
    * **`list`**: List all the guests in GuestBook.

10. In the situation that a guest purchases additional necessities, you can bill the guest using the **`bill`** command. For example, you can bill the third guest a service that costs 30.35 by running the command below.
    * **`bill`** `3` `b/+30.35`: Adds 30.35 to the bill of the third guest.

11. When a guest checkouts, you might want to delete the guest. In that case, you can use the **`delete`** command.
    * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the third guest shown in the current list.

12. To clear your GuestBook of all entries, you can use the **`clear`** command. Do be warn that it is irreversible, so use with caution!
    * **`clear`** : Deletes all guests.

13. Finally, to quit GuestBook, you can run the **`exit`** command.
    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

14. For more details, you can refer to the [Features](#features) below for the exact specifications of each command. Thank you and hope you enjoy using GuestBook!

## FAQ

Listed here are some frequently asked questions. Should you require any other assistance, feel free to [contact us](#contact-us).

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous GuestBook home folder.

**Q**: Will my data be automatically saved?<br>
**A**: Yes, GuestBook automatically saves your data after every command entered.

**Q**: Where is my data saved?<br>
**A**: Go to where you have downloaded your `guestbook.jar` file, there a `/data` folder will be created and the data will be saved under `guestbook.json`.

**Q**: Can I rename my saved data file?<br>
**A**: No, GuestBook currently only supports the use of `guestbook.json` as the name of the saved data file.

**Q**: Why are there no guests in my GuestBook?<br>
**A**: If you didn't enter the `clear` command, it is likely that your `guestbook.json` file is corrupted, causing GuestBook to reset it to prevent any malicious files from being used.
